# fake-hack
A totally real hack script for terminal

Bascially this is a script where you input the name of someone you want to hack and it will *definitely* hack them.

*Inspired by the `pls hack` command from the Dank Memer Discord Bot*

<span style="size: 10px;"><strong>This is not a real hack.  Any claims that this is a real hack are false.  Any beliefs that it is a real hack should be disregarded, as the source code is here as well - take a look and identify for yourselves what it does.</strong></span>
