# fake-hack
A totally real hack script for terminal

[**Download the latest release**](https://github.com/Jminding/fake-hack/releases)

Bascially this is a script where you input the name of someone you want to hack and it will *definitely* hack them.

*Inspired by the `pls hack` command from the Dank Memer Discord Bot*

<span style="size: 10px;"><strong>DISCLAIMER: This is not a real hack.  Any claims that this is a real hack are false.  Any beliefs that it is a real hack should be disregarded, as the source code is here as well - take a look and identify for yourselves what it does.  This is a script that was made just for funl</strong></span>


You might also get this error:
`Fake-hack is not from an identified developer.`  On a Mac, simply right click the file and then click `Open`.  On Windows, if there is an issue, simply go to your Windows Antivirus thing and click `More info` or similar and click `Keep anyway`.  Then, you can run it.
